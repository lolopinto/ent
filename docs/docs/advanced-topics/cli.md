# CLI

`tsent` is the name of the CLI that's used to interact with the schema.

It's used when run via Docker or when [run locally](/docs/advanced-topics/running-locally).

Here are the current supported commands:

## codegen

`codegen` is the mostly commonly used command. It reads the schema, validates it and does the following changes:

* updates the database if there's been any changes
* generates the code for the Ent and GraphQL layer

You can filter to only run one "step" if you don't want to run all steps.

Currently, there are 3 steps:

* `db`: only updates the database schema
* `codegen`: only updates the generated Ent layer
* `graphql`: only updates the GraphQL layer.

You should probably always run all steps but if you need to filter, the option is there.

Run as follows:

```shell
tsent codegen
```

or via docker:

```shell
npm run codegen # (via) ent-starter OR
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent codegen
```

To run just one step:

```shell
tsent codegen --step graphql
```

## upgrade

`upgrade` is used to update the database. Most commonly used after pulling from `main` or [when deploying](/docs/advanced-topics/deploying) to upgrade the database in case there have been any changes.

Run as follows:

```shell
tsent upgrade
```

or via docker:

```shell
npm run upgrade # (via) ent-starter OR
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent upgrade
```

To upgrade to a specific revision, possibly after [downgrading](#downgrade):

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent upgrade {rev}
```

or via docker:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent upgrade {rev}
```

## downgrade

`downgrade` is used to downgrade the database. Used to revert back to a previous database revision.

To downgrade 1 revision:

```shell:
tsent downgrade -- -1
```

or via docker:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent downgrade -- -1
```

To downgrade to a specific revision:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent downgrade {rev}
```

or via docker:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app tsent downgrade {rev}
```

## fix-edges

Fixes the [edges](/docs/ent-schema/edges#assoc-edge-config-table) in the database if corrupted for some reason. It basically goes through the schema and tries to reinsert all edges. If already in the database, does nothing.

## alembic

Runs [alembic commands](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/api/commands.html).

For example, to show the current database revision:

```shell
tsent alembic current
```

or to show the database history:

```shell
tsent alembic history
```

## generate

`generate` is used to generate schema file(s). After generating schema files, it doesn't run the `codegen` command so that still needs to be run.

There are three subcommands:

### schema

```shell
tsent generate schema
```

takes schemaName and 0 or more field specifications separated by a space. field specification has three different formats:

* `name:type`

```shell
tsent generate schema User name:string email:email
```

generates schema file`user.ts` of node `User` with 2 fields.

* `name:type:booleanprop[:booleanprop]`

```shell
tsent generate schema User phone:phone:index email:email:unique password:password:private:hideFromGraphQL age:int:nullable activated:bool
```
  
generates schema file `user.ts` of node `User` with a few fields and some properties set for those files

* `name;type;key:column`

```shell
tsent generate schema User "account_status;string;serverDefault:DEACTIVATED email:email:unique accountId;uuid;foreignKey:{schema:Account;column:id};storageKey:user_id;defaultToViewerOnCreate"
```

Supported types: `string`, `uuid`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `timestamp`, `timestamptz`, `time`, `timetz`, `date`, `email`, `phone`, and `password`.

### enum_schema

```shell
tsent generate enum_schema
```

takes 3 arguments enumSchema name, enum column, csv list of values and generates an [enum schema](/docs/ent-schema/enums#lookup-tables).

e.g.

```shell
tsent generate enum_schema RequestStatus status open,pending,closed
```

generates an enum `RequestStatus` with column `status` and three values: `open`, `pending`, and `closed`.

### schemas

```shell
 tsent generate schemas
```

takes a json file and generates N schemas based on the JSON generated by the TypeScript parse code.

```shell
tsent generate schemas --file schema.json 
// OR
cat schema.json | tsent generate schemas
```
