# Ent Intro

The `Ent` framework was created to free up time for engineers and teams to focus on what's different about their app as opposed to spending time rebuilding the same cruft that's common across different projects.

This is done by providing a balance of code generation + ways to customize things as needed to integrate nicely with the generated code.

It takes a holistic approach and uses the Schema generated to integrate with the following 3 core layers:

* database.
* middle layer where most of the application logic lives.
* GraphQL layer for exposing the data to clients.

It handles the following high level things:

* managing the database along with database migrations using [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
* handles CRUD operations based on the application
* first class GraphQL support
* built in permissions across the stack
* ability to write code to integrate with the generated code
* and lots more

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by using the template from the `ent-starter` [repository](https://github.com/lolopinto/ent-starter).

This requires the following:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
* [Node 14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later installed.
* And one of the database options from below.

There are 3 Database options:
* a local [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) instance installed 
  * a database created via `createdb ent-starter` (or replace with your own database name).
  * if a different database is used, make sure to update the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` env in `docker-compose.dev.yml`
* Postgres Docker image
  * follow the steps in the [README](https://github.com/lolopinto/ent-starter#postgres-docker-image) in the [ent-starter repository](https://github.com/lolopinto/ent-starter)
  * **Note**: instead of `psql`, run `npm run psql` when following the examples below.
* local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file.
  * update the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` env in `docker-compose.dev.yml` to something like `sqlite:///ent-starter.db` to indicate where the db should be stored.


## Your first schema

In the root of your application, run to create the schema directory:

```shell
mkdir -p src/schema
```

After setting the environment up, make your first change by specifying a schema as follows:

```ts title="src/schema/user.ts"
import { BaseEntSchema, Field, StringType } from "@snowtop/ent";
import { EmailType } from "@snowtop/ent-email";
import { PasswordType } from "@snowtop/ent-password";

export default class User extends BaseEntSchema {
  fields: Field[] = [
    StringType({ name: "FirstName" }),
    StringType({ name: "LastName" }),
    EmailType({ name: "EmailAddress", unique: true  }),
    PasswordType({ name: "Password" }),
  ];
}
```

This does a few things:

* It specifies a new node in the schema called `User`.
* It adds 4 explicitly listed fields here: `FirstName`, `LastName`, `EmailAddress`, `Password`.
* and 3 implicitly listed by virtue of extending `BaseEntSchema`: `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
* `FirstName` and `LastName` are strings.
* `EmailAddress` is of type `email` and will be [parsed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-addresses) to be a "valid" email address before storing in the database.
* `EmailAddress` field is marked as unique so we don't have multiple users with the same email address.
* `Password` is of type `password` and hashed and salted using [`bcrypt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) before storing in the database.
* The implicit fields are exactly what you'd expect. The default `id` provided by the framework is of type `uuid`.

Then run the following commands:

```shell
# install additional dependencies
npm install @snowtop/ent-email @snowtop/ent-password
# generate code + update the database
npm run codegen
```

After running `npm run codegen`, here's a list of generated files:

(The first time this is run, it'll take a while because it's downloading the base Docker image).

```shell
  new file:   src/ent/const.ts
  new file:   src/ent/generated/user_base.ts
  new file:   src/ent/index.ts
  new file:   src/ent/internal.ts
  new file:   src/ent/loadAny.ts
  new file:   src/ent/user.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/index.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/resolvers/generated/node_query_type.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/resolvers/generated/query_type.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/resolvers/generated/user_type.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/resolvers/index.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/resolvers/internal.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/schema.gql
  new file:   src/graphql/schema.ts
  new file:   src/schema/schema.py
  new file:   src/schema/versions/e3b78fe1bfa3_2021518203057_add_users_table.py
```

Let's go over a few:

* `src/ent/user.ts` is the public facing API of the `User` object and what's consumed. It's also where [**custom code**](/docs/custom-graphql/custom-accessors) can be added.
* `src/ent/generated/user_base.ts` is the base class for the `User` where more generated code will be added as the schema is changed over time.
* `src/schema/versions/*_add_users_tabl.py` is the generated database migration to add the `users` table
* `src/graphql` is where all the generated GraphQL files are with the GraphQL schema file being:

```graphql title="src/graphql/schema.gql"
type User implements Node {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  emailAddress: String!
}

"""node interface"""
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

type Query {
  node(id: ID!): Node
}
```

After running

```shell
npm run compile && npm start
```

we have a **live** GraphQL server.

## Database changes

Note that the database was also updated by the command run above.

import DatabaseTabs from "../src/components/DatabaseTabs";
import PostgresUsersSrc from "./postgres_users.txt";
import SqliteUsersSrc from "./sqlite_users.txt";

<DatabaseTabs postgres={PostgresUsersSrc} sqlite={SqliteUsersSrc} />

## Adding writes

To support writes, update the schema as follows:

```ts title="src/schema/user.ts"
import { BaseEntSchema, Field, StringType, Action, ActionOperation } from "@snowtop/ent/schema";
import { EmailType } from "@snowtop/ent-email";
import { PasswordType } from "@snowtop/ent-password";

export default class User extends BaseEntSchema {
  fields: Field[] = [
    StringType({ name: "FirstName" }),
    StringType({ name: "LastName" }),
    EmailType({ name: "EmailAddress", unique: true  }),
    PasswordType({ name: "Password" }),
  ];

  actions: Action[] = [
    {
      operation: ActionOperation.Create,
      fields: ["FirstName", "LastName", "EmailAddress", "Password"],
    }
  ];
}
```

re-run ```npm run codegen```

which leads to the following changed files:

```
  new file:   src/ent/user/actions/create_user_action.ts
  new file:   src/ent/user/actions/generated/create_user_action_base.ts
  new file:   src/ent/user/actions/user_builder.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/mutations/generated/mutation_type.ts
  new file:   src/graphql/mutations/generated/user/user_create_type.ts
  modified:   src/graphql/schema.gql
  modified:   src/graphql/schema.ts
  modified:   src/schema/user.ts
```

and the GraphQL schema updated as follows:

```graphql title="src/graphql/schema.gql"
type Query {
  node(id: ID!): Node
}

"""node interface"""
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

type Mutation {
  userCreate(input: UserCreateInput!): UserCreatePayload!
}

type UserCreatePayload {
  user: User!
}

type User implements Node {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  emailAddress: String!
}

input UserCreateInput {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  emailAddress: String!
  password: String!
}
```

Re-compile and restart the server:

```shell
npm run compile && npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql` in your browser and then execute this query:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(input:{firstName:"John", lastName:"Snow", emailAddress:"test@foo.com", password:"12345678"}) {
    user {
      id
      firstName
      emailAddress
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```

We get this error back:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Logged out Viewer does not have permission to create User",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "userCreate"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

Update `src/ent/user/actions/create_user_action.ts` as follows:

```ts title="src/ent/user/actions/create_user_action.ts"
import { Data, IDViewer, AlwaysAllowPrivacyPolicy } from "@snowtop/ent";
import {
  CreateUserActionBase,
  UserCreateInput,
} from "src/ent/user/actions/generated/create_user_action_base";

export { UserCreateInput };

export default class CreateUserAction extends CreateUserActionBase {
  getPrivacyPolicy() {
    return AlwaysAllowPrivacyPolicy;
  }

  viewerForEntLoad(data: Data) {
    return new IDViewer(data.id);
  }
}
```

What changed above:

* added `getPrivacyPolicy` method to change [permissions](/docs/actions/permissions) of who can perform the [action](/docs/actions/action).
* added `viewerForEntLoad` method to change who the [Viewer](/docs/core-concepts/viewer) is for the [Ent](/docs/core-concepts/ent) [load after](/docs/actions/viewer-ent-load).

Re-compile and restart the server:

```shell
npm run compile && npm start
```

Then rerun the GraphQL query again and you should get a response similar to:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "userCreate": {
      "user": {
        "id": "bm9kZTp1c2VyOjQ1Y2RkNmUyLWY2ZmItNDVlMC1iNWIwLWEwN2JlZWVmM2QxOQ==",
        "firstName": "John",
        "emailAddress": "test@foo.com",
        "lastName": "Snow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Query via GraphQL

The generated GraphQL schema allows you to access any node in your entity graph via the following Query:

```graphql title="src/graphql/schema.gql"
type Query {
  node(id: ID!): Node
}
```

`Node` is a polymorphic type and can accept an ID for any type of object. You can query for the User you just created with the following GraphQL query - replacing the ID with the ID returned when you created the user!

```graphql
query ByID {
  node(id:"bm9kZTp1c2VyOjQ1Y2RkNmUyLWY2ZmItNDVlMC1iNWIwLWEwN2JlZWVmM2QxOQ==") {
    id
    ... on User {
      firstName
      lastName
      emailAddress
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The ID exposed to GraphQL is not the same as the ID for the row in the database. GraphQL IDs should be considered opaque by clients of your service. Learn more in the [GraphQL Docs](https://graphql.org/learn/global-object-identification/).

## Custom accessors

Update `src/ent/user.ts` as follows:

```ts title="src/ent/user.ts"
import { UserBase } from "src/ent/internal";
import { Interval } from "luxon";
import { GraphQLInt } from "graphql"
import { gqlField } from "@snowtop/ent/graphql"

export class User extends UserBase {
  @gqlField({
    type: GraphQLInt
  })
  howLong() {
    return Interval.fromDateTimes(this.createdAt, new Date()).count('seconds');
  }
}
```

and then run the following command:

```shell
npm run codegen && npm run compile && npm start
```

and then run the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(input:{firstName:"Sansa", lastName:"Stark", emailAddress:"sansa@stark.com", password:"12345678"}) {
    user {
      id
      firstName
      emailAddress
      lastName
      howLong
    }
  }
}
```

you should get a response similar to:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "userCreate": {
      "user": {
        "id": "bm9kZTp1c2VyOmQ3ZjMzODczLTgwOWUtNGZkMi04YjY4LWQxM2QwNGQwNjYwYw==",
        "firstName": "Sansa",
        "emailAddress": "sansa@stark.com",
        "lastName": "Stark",
        "howLong": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

What changed above:

* added a [custom accessor](/docs/custom-graphql/custom-accessors) using [gqlField](/docs/custom-graphql/gql-field)

## Query the Database

Run the following commands:

import PostgresQueryUsersSrc from "./postgres_query_users.txt";
import SqliteQueryUsersSrc from "./sqlite_query_users.txt";

<DatabaseTabs postgres={PostgresQueryUsersSrc} sqlite={SqliteQueryUsersSrc} />


## Unique Constraint

Running the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(input:{firstName:"Arya", lastName:"Stark", emailAddress:"sansa@stark.com", password:"12345678"}) {
    user {
      id
      firstName
      emailAddress
      lastName
      howLong
    }
  }
}
```

should end with this error because we identified the `EmailAddress` as `unique` in the schema above:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"users_unique_email_address\"",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "userCreate"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

That's a quick introduction to what's supported here. We'll dive deeper into these concepts in the following sections.
